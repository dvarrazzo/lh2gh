Convert tickets from Lighthouse to GitHub
=========================================

The script works on the data generated by the export function in Lighthouse
(Settings and Payment -> Export) and generates data `in a format`__ that can
be imported in GitHub without using the API (with the help of their customer
support).

You need a mapping from Lighthouse user names to GitHub usernames: it should
be saved in a file, one entry per line, tab-separated. One entry should be
``*`` and is a fallback user to associate users without a (known) GitHub
account.  Example::

    # file: psycopg.usermap
    Daniele Varrazzo        ->  dvarrazzo
    Federico Di Gregorio    ->  fogzot
    *                       ->  psycoteam

Note that according to GitHub policy only members of the team can be
associated to the tickets.

The script takes source and destination directories as artuments.  Use
``--help`` to know all the options. Example::

    $ python lh2gh.py --remap-until=17 --users-map-file=psycopg.usermap \
        psycopg-lh psycopg-gh

    $ tar czvf tickets-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S).tar.gz -C psycopg-gh .
