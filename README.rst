Convert tickets from Lighthouse to GitHub
=========================================

The script works on the data generated by the export function in Lighthouse
(Settings and Payment -> Export) and generates data `in a format`__ that can
be imported in GitHub without using the API (with the help of their customer
support).

Note that according to GitHub policy only members of the team can be
associated to the tickets.

The script can remap some of the ticket numbers: if your project has some of
the ticket id allocated you can move overlapping lighthouse tickets to higher
numbers.

You can provide a users mapping to map Lighthouse users to GitHub users and
provide a fallback account to associate tickets and comments of everybody else
(their name will be noted in the ticket/comment body).

Use ``lh2gh.py --help`` to get all the script options. The file
``psycopg.options`` contains the options that were used to migrate the psycopg
project.
